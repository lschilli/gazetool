This repository contains a calibration free gaze tracking system based on freely available libraries and data sets. The system is able to estimate horizontal and vertical gaze directions as well as eye closeness. A system description will be available in:
* `Lars Schillingmann and Yukie Nagai, "Yet Another Gaze Detector: An Embodied Calibration Free System for the iCub Robot", 15th IEEE RAS Humanoids Conference on Humanoid Robots, 2015`

Please cite the above paper when using this module for your research.

## Out of the box demo installation

Make sure you have the following dependencies available / installed:
* QT5: http://www.qt.io/download/
* opencv: http://opencv.org/downloads.html
* boost: http://www.boost.org/
* dlib: http://dlib.net/
* run `getFaceAlignmentModel.sh` in the `data` directory to download dlib's face alignment model which is required for running gazetool.

Compiling
* gazetool uses cmake, thus a standard cmake configure run is required:
`mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`
* run `make`
* run `make install`

## Running gazetool
* Run `gazetool.sh -c 0` to use the first webcam attached to your system

## Manual library installation (no QT is needed)

Make sure you have the following dependencies available / installed:
* opencv: http://opencv.org/downloads.html
* boost: http://www.boost.org/
* dlib: http://dlib.net/
* run `getFaceAlignmentModel.sh` in the `data` directory to download dlib's face alignment model which is required for running gazetool.

Compiling
* cmake is used, thus a standard cmake configure run is required in the data and the src/lib folder
* `cd data`
* `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`
* run `make`
* run `make install`
* `cd ../../src/lib`
* `mkdir build && cd build && cmake ..`
* run `make`
* run `make install`

This will install the library and all necessary configuration files to use it.
Furthermore a cmake module file is created in `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/cmake/gazetool` which can be used to link against this library.

## Technical Notes

* Sync to vblank might negatively affect performance
  * A QT bug might further limit the maximum framerate when using multiple QT GLWidgets
* Some BLAS implementations automatically use multithreading which seems to negatively affect performance in our case.
  * If openblas is used as default blas implementation: set the environment variable `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`
* Optimization notes
 * Include architecture specific optimzation flags such as `-march=native -O3` in `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`
 * Enable `USE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS`, `USE_SSE2_INSTRUCTIONS`, or `USE_SSE4_INSTRUCTIONS` if applicable (used by dlib)
 * make sure blas and lapack libraries are installed
 * gazetool should be able to process 640x480 input at 30fps on most recent machines (including notebooks)
